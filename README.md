# Sentiment-Analysis-with-R
I used R programming language to contrast some models to analysis and predict which one is better
Our datasets have 34792 rows and 2 columns which include text and sentiment.
We dont have missing and the sentiment are 3: Positive, Negative and Nuteral. We merged them on 2.
Here are some charts that we drew:
Thus, after finding the most common words we started tokenization.
Preprocessing in textmining includes: eleminating , ! ? etc. Moreover numbers and cojuctions should be delete.
Steming is one of the most essential part so do not forget it.
Use "Quanteda" package for analyse and use "Naive bayes", "SVM" and "SVM linear.
Using some hallmarks show that the best model is none other than "SVM".
